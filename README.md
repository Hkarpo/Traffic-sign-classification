# Traffic sign classification
Code mainly focuses on task 2 & 3.
## Task (four parts):
1) Classify 19 types of traffic signs based on traditional machine learning methods (such as HOG+SVM classification method).
2) Based on the deep learning method, perform 19 types of traffic annotation classification on the same data as Task 1.
3) Single-sample classification is performed on the additional 11 categories of traffic sign data. Each of the 11 small sample categories provides 1 labeled image, and additional labeled data cannot be introduced for these 11 categories. The model is required to learn to distinguish these 11 categories. , and the 11-category classification results of the test set are given.
4) On the additional given traffic sign detection data set, implement a traffic sign detection model to detect all traffic signs, and use the classifier trained in task one or two to classify the detected traffic signs, giving The results of detection and identification are obtained.
